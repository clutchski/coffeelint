          CoffeeLint is a style checker that helps keep
          <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>
          code clean and consistent. CoffeeScript does a great job at
          insulating programmers from many of
          JavaScript's bad parts, but it won't help enforce a consistent style
          across a code base. CoffeeLint can help with that.
        </p>
        <p>
          CoffeeLint is in its infancy, so feedback is much
          appreciated. If you have an idea, a bug report or anything else
          to say, reach out on the
          <a href="http://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint/issues">issues page</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section_title" id="install">Installation</h2>
        <p>
          To install, make sure you have a working version of the latest
          stable version of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> and
          <a href="http://npmjs.org/">NPM</a> (the Node Package Manager) and then
          run:
        </p>
        <code>
        npm install -g coffeelint
        </code>
        <p>Leave off the <tt>g</tt> if you do not want to install globally.</p>

        <h2 class="section_title" id="usage">Usage</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have Coffeelint installed, to lint your scripts, run:
        </p>
        <code>coffeelint application.coffee</code>
        <p>
          To specify your own configuration file, do the following:
        </p>
        <code>coffeelint -f config.json application.coffee</code>
        <p>
          If any errors were found, a non-zero code will be returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          To generate a configuration file, do
        </p>
        <code>coffeelint --makeconfig &gt; config.json</code>
        <p>
          You can then configure the rules to your liking.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section_title" id="options">Options</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, CoffeeLint will help ensure you are writing idiomatic
          CoffeeScript, but every rule is optional and configurable so it can
          be tuned to fit your preferred coding style. To override any of
          CoffeeLint's default options, <a href="#usage">generate a
          configuration file</a> and tweak it as needed. To enable an option,
          set its level to <tt>error</tt>, and to disable an option, set its
          level to <tt>ignore</tt>. If you set the level to <tt>warn</tt>,
          violations will be reported, but won't cause a non-zero exit code.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a rundown of CoffeeLint's rules:</p>
        <table class="options">
          <thead>

<td class="rule">arrow_spacing</td>
<td class="description">
    <p>This rule checks to see that there is spacing before and after
the arrow operator that declares a function. This rule is disabled
by default.</p> <p>Note that if arrow_spacing is enabled, and you

either a space or no space in-between the arrow operator and the
parenthesis</p>
<pre><code># Both of this will not trigger an error,
# even with arrow_spacing enabled.

          <h2 class="section_title" id="api">API</h2>
          <p>
            If you'd like to run CoffeeScript in the browser or any other
            Javascript runtime, include
            <a href="http://coffeescript.org/extras/coffee-script.js">coffee-script.js</a>
            and
            <a href="http://www.coffeelint.org/js/coffeelint.js">
              coffeelint.js
            </a>
            and you're off to the races. Then you can call CoffeeLint directly
            with the following API:
          </p>
          <h3 class="api_call">coffeelint.lint(source, configuration)</h3>
          <p>
            Lints the CoffeeScript source with the given configuration
            and returns an array of lint errors and warnings. If the array is
            empty, all is well.  Compile time errors will be thrown.
            An error is a Javascript object with the following properties:
          </p>
<pre><code>{
    rule :      'Name of the violated rule',
    lineNumber: 'Number of the line that caused the violation',
    level:      'The severity level of the violated rule',
    message:    'Information about the violated rule',
    context:    'Optional details about why the rule was violated'
}</code></pre>

          <h3 class="api_call">coffeelint.registerRule(RuleConstructor)</h3>
          <p>
            Registers a custom rule that may be run by CoffeeLint. If the rule
            is ignored by default it will still require overriding it's level
            just like the default rules. They have actually all be
            re-implemented as pluggable rules that come bundled in CoffeeLint.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section_title" id="api">Loading Custom Rules (NEW 0.6)</h2>
          <p>
            Not every possible rule will be included in the CoffeeLint project.
            Maybe it's very specific to your project, or it's not specific to
            CoffeeScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, maybe you want to get a warning if you don't have a
            newline at the end of your files We'll imagine you globally
            installed the fictional package "coffeelint-newline-eof".
          </p>
          <!-- Found this example at https://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint/pull/79 -->
<pre><code>{
    // This name MUST match the default configuration of the rule being loaded.
    "no_eof_newline": {
        // NodeJS module to load. It can also be a path to the rule (useful for devleopment)
        "module": "coffeelint-newline-eof",
        // Maybe the rule author set it to error by default and you only want a warning.
        "level": "warn"
    }
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Now every time you run CoffeeLint it will load that rule and
            override it's default level to "warn".
          </p>

          <h2 class="section_title" id="api">Building Custom Rules (NEW 0.6)</h2>
          <p>
              CoffeeLint has three types of linters that run. In no particular order they are.
          
              <ul>
                  <li>LineLinter: processes one line at a time, usually with regular expressions</li>
                  <li>TokenLinter: processes the token stream generated by CoffeeScript.</li>
                  <li>ASTLinter: Processes the Abstract Syntax Tree. AST rules are
                  only called with the root node and it is up to the rule to
                  recurse the tree.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
              Rules may be loaded using <pre><code>--rules /path/to/rules/</code></pre> or
              <pre><code>coffeelint.registerRule(RuleConstructor)</code></pre> when
              outside of the CLI.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rules do not have to be written in CoffeeScript. A new instance of
            each rule is constructed for each file, so the RuleConstructor must
            be a constructor function that generates a new clean instance of
            your rule when the new operator is used.
          </p>

          <p>
              Your rule instance must have a .rule attribute with it's default
              configuration. "name", "level" "message", and "description" are
              all required. "level" must be one of 'ignore', 'warn', or
              'error'. Once you have a valid rule configuration CoffeeLint
              requires you to implement one function depending on which type of
              linter your rule needs.

              <code>
                  lintLine(line, lineApi)<br/>
                  lintToken(token, tokenApi)<br>
                  lintNode(node, astApi)
              </code>

              The second parameter of each is an object with helper functions.
              It's best to just check the source or look at how other plugins
              are using those.
          </p>

          <p>
              If your function returns true it will generate an error. If you
              need override how the error is generated, maybe providing a
              context attribute, you can return an object that will get mixed
              into the generated error. The NoPlusPlus is a simple example of
              this.
          </p>

          <p>
            The core rules have been rewritten as stand alone rules both to
            prove the system and provide examples of how to write rules.
            To get started no_plus_plus is a Token rule, no_tabs is a Line rule, 
            and cyclomatic_complexity is an AST rule.
          </p>

          <p>
              The <pre>--rules</pre> option will load every .js or .coffee file
              it finds and assume they export the RuleConstructor. Since the
              browser doesn't have a standard export system it's up to you to
              determine how you'll load your plugin and register it with
              <pre>coffeelint.registerRule</pre>
          </p>
